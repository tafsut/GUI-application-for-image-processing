# GUI-application-for-image-processing
This application allows you to use the algorithms of image processing in OpenCV easily

this application is designed using Qt Designer 5.6
the algorithm of image processing are implemeted in OpenCV 2.4
you must integrate OpenCV in QT by genrating the libraries of OpenCV, I used a Cmake to do so, and the including libraries are done in the .pro file of QT
